    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Recently I have been trying to use up my old art supplies: crusty
      tubes of paint, inch-long pencils, you name it. The latest
      installment of this was when I turned my
      attention to the forgotten basket I had filled with balls of
      yarn. The yarn had been given to me years ago by a family
      friend, and I had held onto it in the hopes of learning to knit,
      but my needles had languished along with the yarn, and now I
      figured it was long-past time to put the yarn to better use. I
      chose to make a cozy pom-pom rug, which would do the double duty
    of using up some of my fabric that was in good shape but not a
    pattern I liked. The project is detailed here.</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>Yarn - As much as you have on hand. It takes a lot!</li>
	<li>Fabric - Size of rug</li>
	<li>Sewing scissors</li>

      <h2>How To</h2>
      <p>
      There are plenty of pom-pom rug tutorials out there, but use
      this one if you want a fabric base. Chances are, you already
      have an old T-shirt or piece of fabric lying around that can be
      repurpused and - guess what? - it is easily turned into a free
      rug.
      </p>
      <ol>
	<li>Take a ball of yarn and wind it around your hand
	approximately 50 times or until you have reached an ideal
	thickness.</li>
	<li>Take another piece of yarn and wrap it around the
	bundle. Tie it off tightly.</li>
	<li>Remove the bundle of yarn from your hand and cut it so
	there are no loops. Trim all the pieces of yarn to be the same
	sides besides the piece you used to tie it together.</li>
	<li>When you have made enough pom-poms (it is more than you
	think) use a pair of scissors to cut two small slits in your
	fabric. Use the long the long tail of yarn from a pom-pom to
	tie it through the slits and onto the fabric.</li>
	<li>Repeat step four until the fabric is completely
	covered. Trim an excess yarn, and enjoy your new rug.</li>
      </ol>

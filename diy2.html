    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Do you have a desk crowded with receipts, anouncements,
      notes to yourself, etc? I sure do. It sometimes requires a major
      expedition just to find my to-do list. Honestly, it's a great
      achievement for me to cross off Find To-Do List from my to-do
      list. So with this project, I hoped to vanquish - or at least
      diminish - my personal paper avalanche. I decided a sort of
      message board would be just the thing to display papers and keep
      my desk clear. I had an unused magnetic whiteboard and some old magnets which would do the duty of
      holding up my important papers. But the magnets, while
      serviceable, were rust-covered and seriously unencouraging in my
      decluttering goals. When choosing between sorting through files
      and prettying up some magnets, my choice was obvious. The
      results of my magnet-painting efforts are shown here.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>Gather your materials:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Primer</li>
	<li>Paint</li>
	<li>Brush</li>
	<li>Old magnets - Choose some with fun shapes!</li>
	<li>Old Newspaper</li>
	<li>Sharpie</li>
	<li>Sandpaper and mask - if magnets are rusty</li>
	<li>Modpodge or substitute</li>
	</ul>

<h2>The Project</h2>
      <ol>
	<li>Spread the newspaper out on a flat surface. I would
	suggest a desk, as you are going to be spending some time bent
	over your work surface.</li>
	<li>If the magnets are rusty, use the sandpaper to get as much
	as possible off. A face mask can be worn during this, but you
	should be OK if you sand the magnets directly over a trash can
	and don't stick your face right next to them.</li>
	<li>Prime the magnets. One coat should do it on all but the
	brightest of colors.</li>
	<li>Wait for the primer to dry completely, then paint a coat
	of your favorite color paint over it. Do not layer the coat
	too thickly. After the paint dries, add another coat
	or...</li>
	<li>Sharpie some fun designs on your finished magnet. As mine
	were cat-shaped to begin with, I went with cat designs.</li>
	<li>Finish by sealing the magnets with Modpodge or something similar.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tip: Create a fun and inexpensive display by using your new
      spiffied up magnets to hold up old travel postcards. Along with
      your to-do list, of course!</p>

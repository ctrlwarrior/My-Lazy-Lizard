    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>If you are anything like me, you find it difficult to start a
journal and keep one. I have one whole shelf of notebooks that have
been half filled and then forgotten. But I have learned through trial
and error which types of journals I find easiest to keep up with. I
often find myself out of the time at the end of the day, so any type
of journal which requires me to sit down every day and write out a
journal entry is out of the question. And while I do have notebooks
for things like to-do-lists or scheduling, they lack a certain
reflective quality. Enter the art journal. I discovered this type of
journaling recently and have already become hooked - despite its name,
art journaling is not just for artists. Anyone can doodle in one, or
even write down entries like a traditional journal. Art journals are
extremely flexible. You can work on it every day, or just whenever you
happen to have time, which is closer to what I tend to do. Art
journaling is a great way to start doing something creative, and I
recommend you all give it a try! Some of my ideas and directions posted below, as it can often be difficult to know where to start. Let
      the art journaling begin!</p>
      </div>
<h2>Journal Type</h2>
<p>There are an infinite number of journals out there. Choose the one
that works best for your budget and you like the style of. I prefer
unlined paper, since I will be drawing in it, and a spiral binding
works well, as it can be easily layed flat. I chose a relatively small
notebook for easy transport, but if you prefer larger spreads, a big
      drawing pad is a good choice.</p>

<h2>Front Cover</h2>
<p>Obviously, you do not have to choose to decorate your cover, but if
you do, it can add a personal touch to your journal and help protect
the sometimes flimsy cardboard journal covers are often made out
of. Even if you do not decorate your cover, I highly recommend that
you write your name and some sort of identification on the inside
cover so your journal can be returned to you if it is lost.
Here is how to make a journal cover similar to mine:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Cut interesting pictures out of magazines. (I chose
  butterflys)</li>
  <li>Arrange pictures in a pleasing manner on the page. Lightly trace
  outline of shapes on to cover, then remove.</li>
  <li>Glue pictures down using small amounts of glue. Use a craft
  stick to gently smooth the pictures down and remove any
  bubbles.</li>
  <li>If you would like any text on your cover, write or stamp it
  now. I used a Fine Point Sharpie to write mine.</li>
  <li>After the glue for the pictures has dried, paint the cover of
  the journal with a thin layer of Mod Podge.</li>
  <li>After the Mod Podge has dried, paint another layer on. This step
  should be repeated as many times as necessary. My cover took three
  coats to achieve an even gloss.</li>
  <li>I would also recommend that you coat the Mod Podge with a
  sealant, especially if you plan on taking your journal around with
  you. The Mod Podge remains slightly tacky even after it drys and the
  journal will stick to things if it is not sealed!</li>
</ol>
  <h2>Inside the Journal</h2>
  <p>There are infinite options for how to fill your art
  journal. Choose whatever inspires you! Some of my pages include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Illustrated quotes</li>
    <li>Paint chips I liked</li>
    <li>Fun color names</li>
    <li>Collages</li>
    <li>Painted cut outs from coloring books - They look much more
    professional that way!</li>
